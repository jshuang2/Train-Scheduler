# Train-Scheduler
This application tracks and calculates the arrival time of various train routes and displays them in an easy to read format. Data is stored via Google's Firebase.

Visit https://jshuang2.github.io/Train-Scheduler/ to view the application.

### Technologies Used
- Moment JS
- Google Firebase
- Javascript, HTML, CSS

## How it works
 
1. This one page application allows users to view the current train schedules. Schedules are calculated in real time via data stored in Google Firebase.

2. If a user wants to add a new train to the scheduler, they can do so via the form at the bottom of the page. Any train added will be stored in Google Firebase.

## Future Considerations

1. Add interval functionality to update "minutes to  arrival" and "next train" live without having to refresh the page.

2. Add "update" and "remove" buttons so users can easily adjust the table of trains.

3. Add authentication in some way.
