# Train-Scheduler
This web application tracks and calculates the arrival time of various train routes and displays them in an easy to read format.

Visit https://jshuang2.github.io/Train-Scheduler/ to view the application.

## Future Considerations

1. Add interval functionality to update "minutes to  arrival" and "next train" live without having to refresh the page.

2. Add "update" and "remove" buttons so users can easily adjust the table of trains.

3. Add an authentication method with either Google or Github via Firebase.
